# manta-mako

This repository is part of the Joyent Manta project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[Manta](http://github.com/joyent/manta) project page.

Mako can refer to this repository or the zone in Manta that stores Manta
objects.  The zone that stores objects is also known as a "storage" zone.
[Nginx](http://nginx.org/) is the server that actually puts and gets the objects
to/from disk.

# Working with the nginx git submodule

mako uses [Joyent's fork of nginx](https://github.com/joyent/nginx)
which has been modified to support some additional features:

* Calculates the md5 checksum of the streamed body and reports it.
* Ensures that all renames are atomic in the filesystem (proper use of
  fsync(2)).
* Adds support for the multipart upload commit operation.

To understand how the nginx repository is managed and how we cut
releases for use in mako, please read the
[README](https://github.com/joyent/nginx).  When updating the nginx
submodule in mako, the first step is to identify the release tag that
you should use. Once that's been identified, you can update the
submodule using something like the following flow:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:joyent/manta-mako.git
$ cd mako/
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cd deps/nginx/
$ git checkout <tag>
$ cd ../..
$ git add deps/nginx
$ git diff --cached #to check the submodule git SHA
```

Then you can commit, test, and push like any other change.

## Testing

To run the mako test suite, you need to be able to run nginx in your
zone. The following should be run as a root user (or by a user who can
use pfexec as the primary administrator):

1. `gmake release`
2. Manually edit `build/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` to clean up the sapi manifest
2. `mkdir /manta`
3. `chmod 770 /manta`
4. `chown nobody:staff /manta`
5. Manually start nginx, by running `build/nginx/sbin/nginx`
6. Run the test suite by running `gmake test`
7. When finished, kill the nginx processes with something like `pkill -9 nginx`
8. When finished, clean out any left over temporary data via `rm -rf /manta/*`

Note, that the tests default to looking for nginx on
`http://localhost:80/`. This can be overriden by setting the `MAKO_HOST`
and `MAKO_PORT` environment variables. For example if you set
`MAKO_PORT=8080` and `MAKO_HOST=1.2.3.4`, we would instead look for a
server at `http://1.2.3.4:8080/`.

## SAPI Tunables

    MAKO_PROCESS_MANIFEST      Boolean value which when set, enables the post
                               processing of a mako manifest to produce a
                               summary as well.  The summary provides
                               storage consumption details on a per-account
                               basis along with a global total.  Both the full
                               manifest and the summary are uploaded to
                               /poseidon/stor/mako and
                               /poseidon/stor/mako/summary respectively.
